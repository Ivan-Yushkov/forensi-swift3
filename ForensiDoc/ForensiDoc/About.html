        	<h1>ForensiDoc®</h1>
        <p>ForensiDoc® is an App that is designed to allow secure recording and documentation of health, forensic,  or scene assessments in a wide variety of settings.  It has been designed to allow simple capture of all relevant information and outputting it as an editable  Word document with accompanying hand-drawn diagrams, images, audio and video files.   The App uses the drawing,  camera and recording facilities of the device being used.
        It is intended for use primarily by healthcare and forensic practitioners who may be working independently or in a range of settings,  both indoors and outdoors.
        However ForensiDoc® can also be used by lay people without health, scientific or technical knowledge to record data in settings (such as road traffic collisions,  witnessing possible criminal incidents) where immediacy and accuracy of recording are needed.
        The App allows consent to be sought for a range of functions.
        Such data can be used as evidence in a variety of legal, judicial and tribunal settings.

        The App can capture data about injuries, scenes, implements,  locations, damage to property, geo-locating and accurately timing it.</p>
